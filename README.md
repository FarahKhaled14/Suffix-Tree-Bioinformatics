#Suffix-Tree-Bioinformatics

This project implements a **Trie (suffix tree)** in C++ for **pattern matching** in DNA/protein sequences.

## My Focus: Pattern Matching
Implemented the logic to build a suffix tree and search for a specific **pattern** in a biological sequence. Demonstrated usage with DNA strings.

## Teamwork Acknowledgement
The functionality for **Longest Common Substring (LCS)** was contributed by my colleague Kirolos Helmy.

## How to Run
- Open `main.cpp` in any C++ compiler
- Follow prompts to enter sequences or patterns
- Observe results for:
  - Pattern detection in sequences
  - LCS between two input strings

## Applications
- Bioinformatics sequence search
- Genomics pattern discovery
- Trie structure practice
